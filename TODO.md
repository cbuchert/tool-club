# TODO.md — Tool Club

Last updated: 2026-04-08

Work this list top to bottom unless instructed otherwise. Before starting a task,
re-read AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and SPEC.md. Mark tasks `[x]` when done.
Add notes inline when a task reveals decisions that affect other tasks.

## 3. SvelteKit foundation

- [ ] Create `src/app.css` with Tailwind import and full `@theme` token block
  (reference ARCHITECTURE.md design system section for all token values)
- [ ] Import font links (Fraunces, DM Mono) in `src/app.html`
- [ ] Create `src/lib/server/db.ts` — Supabase server client (service role +
  per-request anon client)

  `locals.user`
- [ ] Create root `+layout.server.ts` — load session, redirect unauthenticated
  users to `/signin` (except public routes)
- [ ] Create root `+layout.svelte` — shell, sidebar nav, mobile nav; import
  `src/app.css`
- [ ] Define public routes list (landing, signin, auth/callback, join/[token],
  feed/public)

## 4. Auth routes

- [ ] Invite revoke action
- [ ] Feed token regeneration action
- [ ] Account deletion action (see SPEC.md for anonymization rules + host blocker)

## 10. Admin

- [ ] `/admin` — home with links to events and members
- [ ] `/admin/events` — all events (draft, upcoming, past)
- [ ] `/admin/events/[id]` — event edit form, headcount view, RSVP list
- [ ] Admin event create/edit/publish/delete actions
- [ ] Promote suggestion to event action

- [ ] `mark-past-events` function (service role, see ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] `expire-invites` function (service role)

## 12. Content pages

- [ ] Create `content/landing.md`
- [ ] Wire mdsvex to render it at `/`
- [ ] Create `content/about.md` (optional in v1)

## 13. Playwright E2E tests

Write tests after the feature is built and working locally.

- [ ] Auth: sign in → magic link → session established
- [ ] Auth: invite flow end to end (new member creation)
- [ ] Auth: expired invite shows correct error
- [ ] Events: member sees published events, not drafts
- [ ] Events: RSVP yes → count increments → RSVP no → count decrements
- [ ] Events: capacity enforcement (going button disabled when full)
- [ ] Suggestions: vote toggle
- [ ] Suggestions: propose → appears in list
- [ ] Feed: private RSS requires valid token
- [ ] Feed: public RSS returns no member data
- [ ] Admin: publish a draft event → visible to members
- [ ] Admin: promote suggestion → event created in draft

## 14. Pre-launch

- [ ] Verify dark mode (all `prefers-color-scheme` tokens render correctly)
- [ ] Verify mobile layout (sidebar hidden, mobile nav shown at ≤640px)
- [ ] Verify all pgTAP tests pass against hosted Supabase
- [ ] Verify Playwright tests pass in CI
- [ ] Seed production database with initial admin user
- [ ] Test invite flow end to end in production
- [ ] Set up custom domain on Vercel (if applicable)
